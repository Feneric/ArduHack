     +==============================================================================+

ArduHack is a satellite based on the current ArduSat's in orbit around the Earth. ArduSats are a class of nano
satellites (10 cm x 10cm x 10cm). By the name you may have guessed they involve an arduino (3 in total) and have
over 25 sensors used for a variety of things.
We were set the challenge of enhancing the functionality of the current ArduSats; we decided to make an earth (and 
possibly horizon) tracking feature that relays images and data collected from the satellite and displays it on a 
web server. We chose a webserver, instead of say an Iphone app, as the webserver is cross platform allowing a variety of
devices to use it.
I was set the task of getting the data and images and sending them to said server, hence the code here is for just that.

See our instructable for the whole project.
